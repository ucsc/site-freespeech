Whether using amplified sound, bringing in a speaker or displaying symbolic structures in the Quarry Plaza, there are many things to consider. When planning an event, a registered student organization (RSO) must make space reservations through [Student Organization Advising & Resources](http://soar.ucsc.edu/v2/). Once space is reserved, SOAR can help provide logistical support and guidance, including help with time, place and manner regulations, to set the stage for a successful event.
