## Planning an Event or Protest

When planning an event or protest, organizers have several questions to consider including:

* Where is my protest going to be held?    
* What kind of activities will my protest include?    
* What restrictions or policies do I need to follow?

UC Santa Cruz has published this [Major Event Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWCcgWxDKt85zbMiUtvSOXpMPbAi4-zMrmnibwoYSY8kistw/viewform) to streamline and simplify the process for Event Organizers to develop policy-compliant events hosted on University Controlled Property.  

If you are organizing an event or protest as a representative of a Registered Student Organization (RSO), you must proceed with [Event Planning through Student Organization Advising & Resources](https://getinvolved.ucsc.edu/student-organizations/plan-event/) (SOAR).  SOAR can help provide logistical support and guidance, including help with relevant University policies, to set the stage for a successful protest.  

## Expressive Activities

Expressive Activities such as protests, strikes, rallies, vigils, marches, etc are governed by the [UCSC Student Handbook](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/index.html), [Conduct Regulations (Time, Place, and Manner)](https://ucscpolicy.ellucid.com/pman/documents/view/218/), California Penal Code, and the California Code of Regulations.  These regulations are content-neutral and grounded in First Amendment protections.  Examples of these regulations include:

* **Time**:  Amplified sound is limited to certain hours.  
* **Place**:  Posting of information on university buildings is limited to designated bulletin boards.  
* **Manner**:  Distribution of literature may not obstruct the ingress and egress from university buildings.

Certain activities that are common during these protests require advance permitting, these include:

* [Use of Outdoor Amplified Sound](https://forms.gle/5DoDaHKPTue7VbzH7) (such as loudspeakers and blowhorns)  
* [Use of Temporary Structures](https://forms.gle/LWTZSTPW5xryuFXc7) (such as canopies and platforms)  
* [Use of Open Flames](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/fire-prevention/special-events/open-flame-application.pdf) (such as candles and barbecues)  
* [Special Events](https://ehs.ucsc.edu/programs/fire-prevention/special-events/events_emergency_response_plan_ucsc-2022.pdf) (such as roadway marches and parades)

## Activity Locations

Several areas have been specifically designated as public forums, including:

* Quarry Amphitheater  
* College “quadrangles”  
* Grassy area between the University of California sign and the Granary and Stone House buildings near the intersection of High Street and Coolidge Drive.  
* Quarry Plaza

In addition to the list above, expressive activities may occur at all “university grounds open to the public”, which the University defines as:  
*“outdoor areas of the campus (e.g. lawns, patios, plazas) that are at least 100 feet from the entrances/exits of campus buildings and parking lots, and that are also a safe distance from the curbing of campus roads.”*  

In all cases, groups that specifically reserve these spaces for planned events have priority for use over activities that do not reserve the space.

## Reserving Space

Some protests will require that the Protest Organizer specifically request to use a University facility or space.  Depending on the space you want to reserve, you may need to follow a specific process.  The links below will direct you to the appropriate campus unit for the type of facility or space you will need to reserve.
