Whether using amplified sound, bringing in a speaker or displaying symbolic structures in the Quarry Plaza, there are many things to consider. When planning an event, a registered student organization (RSO) must make space reservations through [Student Organization Advising & Resources](http://soar.ucsc.edu/). Once space is reserved, SOAR can help provide logistical support and guidance, including help with time, place and manner regulations, to set the stage for a successful event. Learn more by visiting [SOARâ€™s website](https://soar.ucsc.edu/event-planning/index.html).

**Time, Place and Manner Restrictions**

In public forums such as Quarry Plaza, the university may not regulate the content of speech but can place reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. Examples of permissible university time, place, and manner restrictions include:

- Time: Amplified sound is limited to certain hours. 
- Place: [Posting of information](https://someca.ucsc.edu/plan-your-project/protocols.html#posting-fliers) on university buildings is limited to designated bulletin boards.
- Manner: Distribution of literature may not [obstruct the ingress and egress](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/100.003.pdf) from university buildings. 

A more complete list of university time, place, and manner restrictions can be found in the [Student Handbook](https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/student-conduct/student-handbook/index.html) and the [Major Events Policy](https://ucscpolicy.ellucid.com/pman/documents/view/238/?security=44967c3c459180e329345982ccada27606a02039).
