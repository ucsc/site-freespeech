The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is only 45 words long, yet it protects our most basic freedoms. It reads in full:

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

>*“But, above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”<br/><br />
—Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley (1972)*
