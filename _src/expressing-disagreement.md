### Expressing Disagreement Before, After or During an Event

- Write guest editorials or send letters to campus newspapers, Student Union Assembly/Graduate Student Association/campus resources, political representatives, groups, individuals, administrators or responsible parties.
- Lend support, reassurance and empathy to others who may be hurt by offensive messages.
- Be sure to comply with all [University of California policies](http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/ucpolicies/aos/toc.html), [UCSC policies](https://policy.ucsc.edu/), and local, state and federal regulations.

### Expressing Disagreement During an Event

**Inside the room or event**

- You may engage in peaceful, non-disruptive protest (for example, messages on shirts, turning your back to a speaker, putting tape over your mouth) if it does not create a disturbance or prevent the speaker from communicating to the audience, or otherwise prevent audience members from hearing and seeing the event.
- Audience members may choose to leave the event as long as they do not obstruct the presentation.
- If you disrupt or obstruct the presentation and fail to comply with the directions of university officials to cease disruption or leave the area, you will violate the university's code of conduct and/or the law. These are grounds for discipline or prosecution.
- For events held where access to the event space can be controlled/secured, event sponsors may regulate what may be brought into an event space (such as video cameras or other recording devices) and activities that attendees may engage in; regulations such as these are permitted as they relate to time/place/manner (i.e., conduct) and not content.

**Outside the building, room or event.**

- Peaceful protest or picketing with leaflets, petitions, singing, chanting or signs is allowed as long as it occurs in a space that is open to the public and does not disturb the event or prevent attendees from entering or leaving the event.
- Do not block entrances or exits, impede pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or prevent others from entering, hearing, seeing or leaving the event or speech.
- Do not use amplified sound unless allowed by applicable university sound policies.
- Do not disrupt university functions or activities (such as nearby classes) or other events or programs using reserved space.

### Expressing Disagreement in Response to an Event

Before, after or during the event, you can respond to speech that you disagree with by sponsoring a separate presentation or event featuring alternative viewpoints, such as a:

- Teach-in
- Public forum
- Vigil
- Counter-demonstration
- Exhibit

If you are confronted with offensive speech or materials:

- Maintain a safe distance, and do not respond physically.
- Keep in mind that even though you find it offensive, it is very likely protected free speech.
- Consider organizing an appropriate, nonviolent response.
- Seek assistance from a university official if you feel you or others are being singled out or targeted or if you think that the conduct or speech violates university policy.
