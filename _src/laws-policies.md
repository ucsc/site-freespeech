The University of California is committed to upholding and preserving principles of academic freedom. These principles reflect the University’s fundamental mission, which is to discover knowledge and to disseminate it to its students and to society at large. The principles of academic freedom protect freedom of inquiry and research, freedom of teaching, and freedom of expression and publication. These freedoms enable the University to advance knowledge and to transmit it effectively to its students and to the public. The University also seeks to foster in its students a mature independence of mind, and this purpose cannot be achieved unless students and faculty are free within the classroom to express the widest range of viewpoints in accord with the standards of scholarly inquiry and professional ethics. The exercise of academic freedom entails correlative duties of professional care when teaching, conducting research, or otherwise acting as a member of the faculty. These duties are set forth in the Faculty Code of Conduct (APM - 015).

### **Words from UCSC**

> Free speech is both constitutionally protected and a fundamental value of our campus, and we have strong policies in place that protect it. Every part of the university mission depends on the robust exchange of ideas and freedom of inquiry. We embrace our responsibility to sustain the expression of a wide range of viewpoints without implying our endorsement of them.

> It is not always easy to align our responsibility for protecting free speech with our values as a community. We are committed to fostering an inclusive community, especially for those traditionally under-represented, and at times, viewpoints espoused by those speaking on our campus or at events sponsored by campus affiliates challenge our community-building efforts. The exchange ideas and viewpoints can be uncomfortable, but it is a vital process that we work to improve all the time. If we are committed to the advancement of knowledge and justice, which we are, we must be committed to freedom of expression.

> Universities, importantly, also have the ability to model respectful discourse, to show how those who hold opposing points of view can engage passionately but also civilly and respectfully. 

> *–Chancellor Cynthia Larive*
