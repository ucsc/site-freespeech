As a public university, UC Santa Cruz is governed by the same laws as any government body. That means that all members of our community enjoy the protections of the First Amendment. This freedom is essential, but it also has the potential to offend and even to hurt.

While the university cannot protect people—representing a broad spectrum of beliefs—from potential distress that may arise from the expression of ideas and opinions they may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive, we do acknowledge the impact others exercising their right to free expression can have and offer the following resources as places to find support and community.

### Confidential Resources

[**Counseling and Psychological Services**](https://caps.ucsc.edu/)

CAPS provides UCSC students with a wide range of mental health and wellness services. We also provide preventative outreach and consultation services to the UCSC community. Counseling services are available for any registered UCSC student and are confidential. There is no out-of-pocket fee for CAPS services, and you don't need UC SHIP or CruzCare to be seen at CAPS.

If you are not in a crisis and want to arrange an initial therapy appointment, call CAPS at (831) 459-2628.

[**Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education**](https://care.ucsc.edu/) (Students, faculty and staff)

CARE is committed to responding to the needs of the community impacted by sexual violence, dating/domestic violence and stalking by providing prevention and intervention services, confidential advocacy, and support. CARES seeks to create a culture of consent and respect on campus, empower survivors, and dismantle norms of violence. 

[**Problem and Complaint Resolution**](https://ombuds.ucsc.edu/)

The Problem and Complaint Resolution website direct students, faculty, and staff to information and resources that can help address a wide range of concerns, from interpersonal conflict to criminal wrong-doing. Some resources, such as counseling, are private and confidential; others exist to facilitate the reporting of policy violations (like discrimination or unethical conduct). In some cases, reporting can be done anonymously. 

[**Employee Assistance Program**](https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/)

Employees have access to counseling and support services available under the Employee Assistance Program.

[**Resource Centers**](https://resourcecenters.ucsc.edu/) 

Each of the six UC Santa Cruz resource centers offer students various services through academic, cultural and community support activities. Throughout the year, the RCs host programs and events that connect students, staff, faculty and community members in both social and professional, academic settings. Students have ample opportunities to network and create community spaces, to engage in stimulating and critical dialogue, and to find connections in hope of building a positive and empowering space for all communities.

[**International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS)**](https://isss.ucsc.edu/)

International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) ensures campus-wide comprehensive internationalization becomes a reality at UC Santa Cruz by bringing some of the world’s most experienced students, scholars, and researchers to UC Santa Cruz. This unit provides advising and assistance to students, scholars, and employees.
