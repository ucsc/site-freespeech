As a public university, UC Santa Cruz is governed by the same laws as any government body. That means that all members of our community enjoy the protections of the First Amendment. This freedom is essential, but it also has the potential to offend and even to hurt.

While the university cannot restrict these liberties, we offer many services to help students cope with the discomfort that the free and open exchange of ideas can bring. This section lists a series of resources where you can go to find support.

### Confidential Resources

[**Counseling and Psychological Services**](https://caps.ucsc.edu/)

CAPS provides UCSC students with a wide range of mental health and wellness services. We also provide preventative outreach and consultation services to the UCSC community. Counseling services are available for any registered UCSC student and are confidential. There is no out-of-pocket fee for CAPS services, and you don't need UC SHIP or CruzCare to be seen at CAPS.

If you are not in a crisis and want to arrange an initial therapy appointment, call CAPS at (831) 459-2628.

[**Campus Advocacy, Resources and Education**](https://care.ucsc.edu/) (Students, faculty and staff)

CARE is committed to responding to the needs of the community impacted by sexual violence, dating/domestic violence and stalking by providing prevention and intervention services, confidential advocacy, and support. CARES seeks to create a culture of consent and respect on campus, empower survivors, and dismantle norms of violence. 

[**Problem and Complaint Resolution**](https://ombuds.ucsc.edu/)

The Problem and Complaint Resolution website direct students, faculty, and staff to information and resources that can help address a wide range of concerns, from interpersonal conflict to criminal wrong-doing. Some resources, such as counseling, are private and confidential; others exist to facilitate the reporting of policy violations (like discrimination or unethical conduct). In some cases, reporting can be done anonymously. 

[**Employee Assistance Program**](https://shr.ucsc.edu/benefits/eap/)

Employees have access to counseling and support services available under the Employee Assistance Program.

### Resource Centers 

Each of the six UC Santa Cruz resource centers offer students various services through academic, cultural and community support activities. Throughout the year, the RCs host programs and events that connect students, staff, faculty and community members in both social and professional, academic settings. Students have ample opportunities to network and create community spaces, to engage in stimulating and critical dialogue, and to find connections in hope of building a positive and empowering space for all communities.

[**African American Resource and Cultural Center:**](http://aarcc.ucsc.edu/)

The mission of the African American Resource and Cultural Center is to provide support for the students in the African/Black community at UC Santa Cruz. The history of the Center is steeped in UCSC tradition; we were the first ethnic resource center on campus after determined and dedicated students of color formed a circle around Hahn Student Services in peaceful protest and demanded that the administration recognize their need for support.

As we progress, we maintain the same sense of determination and dedication that built the African American Resource and Cultural over two decades ago. As an underrepresented minority in the University of California system, we believe it is more imperative than ever to commit to the encouragement and enrichment of students in our community.

[**American Indian Resource Center:**](http://airc.ucsc.edu/)

The AIRC is dedicated to supporting the needs of American Indian students and increasing Native visibility on campus by advocating student centered programs, cultural events, and tools for academic success and well being. The center serves as a vital link between American Indian students, the University, and tribal communities to foster growth through mentoring, leadership opportunities and scholarly development.  The AIRC also serves as a supportive space for students to help ease the transition from home to campus life. 

[**Asian American / Pacific Islander Resource Center:**](http://aapirc.ucsc.edu/)

The Asian American Pacific Islander Resource Center (AA/PIRC) established in 1999, provides and enhances opportunities for developing leadership, building a stronger sense of community on campus, and linking students to community service opportunities. Ultimately, AA/PIRC offers education and dialogue on issues affecting Asian American/Pacific Islanders toward addressing students’ multiple and diverse academic, social, cultural, and other co‐curricular needs. Students can also gain leadership experience through the AA/PIRC Internship, volunteering, and/or participating on student program.

[**Chicanx Latinx Resource Center:**](https://elcentro.ucsc.edu/)

Through campus and community partnerships the mission of EL CENTRO is to promote a critical understanding of Chicanxs and Latinxs within the United States and internationally. We accomplish this mission by offering workshops as well as an extensive programming calendar. Our efforts promote cultural affirmation, social justice values and community service. Students attending our activities gain insight into cultural dynamics, social and political processes and the historical significance of the contributions that Chicanxs and Latinxs have made to the U.S and to the broader world community. 


[**Lionel Cantú Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Intersex Resource Center:**](http://queer.ucsc.edu/)

The Lionel Cantu Queer Resource Center is the nexus of support and advocacy for the LGBTQIA+ community at the University of California, Santa Cruz. We create co-curricular experiences with students, staff and faculty to build a more inclusive campus community for queer and trans people.

We do this through providing programming, workshops, access to knowledge and resources, and dialogue to enrich the lives of the queer and trans community members we serve in all aspects of their identities. 

[**Women's Center:**](http://womenscenter.ucsc.edu/)

The UCSC Women’s Center affirms the dignity and diversity of all women. The center continues and challenges feminist traditions by creating community space for all women and their allies to achieve individual and social change.
