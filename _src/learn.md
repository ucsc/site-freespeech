UC Santa Cruz is committed to assuring that all persons may exercise the constitutionally protected rights of free expression, speech, and assembly. Further, the University seeks to maintain a safe environment for the free expression of ideas and ideals.

The ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints is at the core of this commitment. As campus citizens, it is imperative that we live up to the responsibilities that accompany these rights.

The right of free speech in a university includes the right to acts of peaceful dissent, protests in peaceable assembly, and orderly demonstrations which include picketing and the distribution of leaflets. These are permitted on the UC Santa Cruz campus, subject to approval as to time, place and manner, unless or until they disrupt regular and essential operations of the University or significantly infringe on the rights of others.
